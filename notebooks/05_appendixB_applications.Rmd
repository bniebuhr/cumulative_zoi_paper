# Introduction

In the main text, we present an application of the cumulative Zone of
Influence (ZOI) approach on habitat selection, using reindeer as a model
study. As mentioned there, the approach might be applied way beyond
animal movement ecology studies. In principle, the approach is useful in
any context in which predictor variables (sources of disturbance,
infrastructure, or any other spatial variable) vary in space and are
expected to affect the biological response variable or process being
studied beyond their actual limits. This includes but is not limited to
those studies in which either the distance to the nearest feature is
computed and used as a predictor (e.g. distance to roads in Torres et
al. 2016, or distance to forest edges in Martello et al. 2022) or those
in which the density or amount of a landscape variable is computed (e.g.
Jackson & Fahrig 2015, Miguet 2016, Martin 2018). Review literature
shows that the so-called multiscale approaches have been applied for a
different set of taxa (MacGarigal et al. 2016, Martin 2018) using
distinct biological measures for a wide range of ecological processes
(Martin 2016). Here we present examples of contexts in which our
approach might be useful to estimate cumulative impacts and zones of
influence, and provide studies to illustrate questions in which these
dimensions could have been evaluated.

# Illustrative examples

In table B1, we present some examples of how the cumulative impacts of
landscape disturbance and human infrastructure could be inferred on
different ecological processes, using distinct types of data, for
different response variables and organisms. For instance, studies on
movement and behavioral ecology may evaluate how movement rates (e.g.
Hansbauer et al. 2008) or the probability of an animal being in a given
behavioral state (e.g. Morales et al. 2004) depend on the influence of
disturbances in the landscape, and this influence might be measure
through either the ZOI of the nearest feature or the cumulative ZOI
metrics. Such response measures can based on different types of data
(e.g. locations recorded through GPS, VHF, or other devices,
capture-mark-recapture and camera trap data) for different organisms,
from animals who move actively (e.g. Ramos et al. 2020) to seeds, fungal
spores, or other propagules that are displaced by animals, wind, or
other agents (e.g. Carlo et al 2015, Norros et al. 2012).

Likewise, in the context of populations and communities, for example,
the ZOI metrics related to disturbance sources might be computed around
sampling points, considering multiple radii, and used to fit models
estimating their effects on population-level metrics (growth rate,
survival/mortality, fecundity; e.g. Cerqueira et al. 2021) for basically
any species or on community-level metrics (species diversity metrics,
species abundance, co-occurrence probability, interaction network
metrics; e.g. Torres et al. 2016).

More examples might be found in Table B1. We also provide in the table a
few references illustrating studies in which a similar approach was used
or could be adapted to incorporate an evaluation of cumulative impacts.
In most of these studies, though, only one of the metrics was used - the
distance to the nearest infrastructure or land cover type, related to
the ZOI of the nearest feature, or the density or amount of landscape
variables, related to the cumulative ZOI as presented here.

```

Looking more broadly, the approach can still be useful in other contexts
in which landscape variables measures at different scales might play a
role, e.g. in environmental research involving habitat structural and
abiotic measures (Lowe et al. 2022). For instance, the amount of
different pollutants in landscapes with different amounts of forest,
urban area, and roads could be evaluated, or the amount of pesticides
identified in the water could be tested against the proximity and
cumulative influence of agricutural and forested areas to the sampling
sites (e.g Liu and Yang 2018).

# Using the approach

To apply the cumulative ZOI approach in these different contexts, we
might start by following the same workflow presented in Fig. 2 of the
main text. First, using the spatial variables of interest, we should
compute the two ZOI metrics for multiple radii and shapes, as relevant
for the empirical case. Once this is done, they can be used to annotate
the biological data considering their spatial locations or sampling
sites. Given the table with response and predictor variable data is
ready, equation 1 from the main text might be adapted to look for the
relationship between the sampled biological response variables and the
ZOI and other spatial or non-spatial variables. Here the analyst might
use whatever modeling approach suits the data and context better; the
possibility of cumulative effects of each single spatial variable type
and their scale of effect or zone of influence are already considered
since they were used to compute the ZOI predictor variables. This means
that, in this formulation, it is not necessary to change the model
specification to assess the cumulative impacts of multiple features of a
given type of variable. More details on how this is done in practice are
shown in the [vignettes](https://ninanor.github.io/oneimpact/index.html)
of the `oneimpact` R package.
