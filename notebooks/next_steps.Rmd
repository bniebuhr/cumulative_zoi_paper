## Simulate landscape patterns

- Implement function to calculate distance through GRASS

- Implement function to calculate density through GRASS, using r.mfilter and r.resamp.filter

- Implement exp decay distance - OK!

- Calculate distance between points - OK!

- Allow calc_dist to calculate distance for multiple parameters  
(different methods or different parameters for exp)

- Set a reasonable set of landscapes to tell a history: from random to clustered, plus regular 
  - v1. log dist vs density;
  - v1.2 sqrt dist vs density;
  - v1.3 exp decay dist vs density;
  - v2. dist for all features, exp_decay dist, then min and sum;
  - v3. exp_decay dist vs exp_decay filter

- 1) Try script 2 with tent shape - pmin(ZOI - linear decay, 0)/ZOI instead of distance decay
- 2) Simulate script02 for different realizations (n.clusters, cluster.width), to have more variation in mean_isol 
and the other measures and a more clear relationship between them and the correlation
- 3) Surface parameter, put a threshold to determine the number of pixels using NLMR (instead of using to define weights)

- Simulate points and check correlation - OK!

- See best form to represent this (using dist_points, or ZOI, or what)

## Re-do analysis for reindeer GPS points



Notes

- xx % of the studies still use only the distance to the nearest feature. Many other (yy%) also
use densities or spatial filters derived from the variables, with the main purpose of
analyzing the scale of effect / ZoI of the infrastructure of variable (and possibly the joint
effect at multiple scales). Here we present an additional reason for using desnity-related
measures, which is the possibility to represent the cumulative influence of same-type 
infrastructure in space.

- We only do simulations for point infrastructure; it is harder to simulate real case scenarios for
lines and polygons, but the insights from the point scenarios should hold true for these other cases.

- Maybe instead of saying that one measure is better than the other, the comparison distance vs
cumm effect might be used to test if the effects of multiple infrastructure of the same type 
accumulate over space or not.
