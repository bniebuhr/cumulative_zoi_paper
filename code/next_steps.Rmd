## Simulate landscape patterns

- Implement function to calculate distance through GRASS

- Implement function to calculate density through GRASS, using r.mfilter and r.resamp.filter

- Implement exp decay distance - OK!

- Calculate distance between points - OK!

- Set a reasonable set of landscapes to tell a history: from random to clustered, plus regular

- Simulate points and check correlation

- See best form to represent this (using dist_points, or ZOI, or what)
