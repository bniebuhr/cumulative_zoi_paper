## Estimating the cumulative effect and the zone of influence from multiple anthropogenic infrastructure on biodiversity

This repository contains code and data to reproduce the analyses in Niebuhr et al (_in prep._), on cumulative effects of anthropogenic infrastructure.

This is complemented by R and GRASS GIS functions to perform similar analyses, organized within the `oneimpact` R package.  
The package is available at: https://github.com/NINAnor/oneimpact
