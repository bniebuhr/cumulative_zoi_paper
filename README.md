### Description

This repository contains R notebooks to reproduce the analyses in Niebuhr, B. B., Moorter, B. V., Stien, A., Tveraa, T., Strand, O., Langeland, K., Sandstr√∂m, P., Alam, M., Skarin, A., & Panzacchi, M. (2023). Estimating the cumulative impact and zone of influence of anthropogenic features on biodiversity. Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

The repository includes the notebooks to generate all appendices and analyses and most of the figures (folder `notebooks`). It also includes tex files for the different version of the manuscript (initial submission, revisions, accepted version; folder `text`).

This is complemented by R and GRASS GIS functions to perform similar analyses, organized within the `oneimpact` R package.  
The package is available at: https://github.com/NINAnor/oneimpact.
