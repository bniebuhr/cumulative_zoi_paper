	abstract = {Understanding how animal groups respond to contemporary habitat loss and fragmentation is essential for development of strategies for species conservation. Until now, there has been no consensus about how landscape degradation affects the diversity and distribution of Neotropical bats. Some studies demonstrate population declines and species loss in impacted areas, although the magnitude and generality of these effects on bat community structure are unclear. Empirical fragmentation thresholds predict an accentuated drop in biodiversity, and species richness in particular, when less than 30\% of the original amount of habitat in the landscape remains. In this study, we tested whether bat species richness demonstrates this threshold response, based on 48 sites distributed across 12 landscapes with 9–88\% remaining forest in Brazilian cerrado-f­orest formations. We also examined the degree to which abundance was similarly affected within four different feeding guilds. The threshold value for richness, below which bat diversity declines precipitously, was estimated at 47\% of remaining forest. To verify if the response of bat abundance to habitat loss differed among feeding guilds, we used a model selection approach based on Akaike’s information criterion. Models accounted for the amount of riparian forest, semideciduous forest, cerrado, tree plantations, secondary forest, and the total amount of forest in the landscape. We demonstrate a nonlinear effect of the contribution of tree plantations to frugivores, and a positive effect of the amount of cerrado to nectarivores and animalivores, the groups that responded most to decreases in amount of forest. We suggest that bat assemblages in interior Atlantic Forest and cerrado regions of southeastern Brazil are impoverished, since we found lower richness and abundance of different groups in landscapes with lower amounts of forest. The relatively higher threshold value of 47\% suggests that bat communities have a relatively lower resistance to habitat degradation than other animal groups. Accordingly, conservation and restoration strategies should focus on increasing the amount of native vegetation of landscapes so as to enhance species richness of bats.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in positioning technology facilitates the collection of massive amounts of sequential spatial data on animals. This has led to new opportunities and challenges when investigating animal movement behaviour and habitat selection. Tools like Step Selection Functions (SSFs) are relatively new powerful models for studying resource selection by animals moving through the landscape. SSFs compare environmental attributes of observed steps (the linear segment between two consecutive observations of position) with alternative random steps taken from the same starting point. SSFs have been used to study habitat selection, human-wildlife interactions, movement corridors, and dispersal behaviours in animals. SSFs also have the potential to depict resource selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. There are several aspects of SSFs where consensus has not yet been reached such as how to analyse the data, when to consider habitat covariates along linear paths between observations rather than at their endpoints, how many random steps should be considered to measure availability, and how to account for individual variation. In this review we aim to address all these issues, as well as to highlight weak features of this modelling approach that should be developed by further research. Finally, we suggest that SSFs could be integrated with state-space models to classify behavioural states when estimating SSFs.},

Unfortunately, large-scale effects of these structures remain generally overlooked. Here, we analyzed the European transportation infrastructure network and found that 50\% of the continent is within 1.5 km of transportation infrastructure. We present a method for assessing the impacts from infrastructure on wildlife, based on functional response curves describing density reductions in birds and mammals (e.g., road-effect zones), and apply it to Spain as a case study. The imprint of infrastructure extends over most of the country (55.5\% in the case of birds and 97.9\% for mammals), with moderate declines predicted for birds (22.6\% of individuals) and severe declines predicted for mammals (46.6\%). Despite certain limitations, we suggest the approach proposed is widely applicable to the evaluation of effects of planned infrastructure developments under multiple scenarios, and propose an internationally coordinated strategy to update and improve it in the future.},

Before the 1980s, most disturbance studies were behavioral studies of individual animals at local scales, reporting few and shortterm (min to h) impacts within 0–2 km from human activity. Around the mid 1980s, focus shifted to regional-scale landscape studies, reporting that Rangifer reduced the use of areas within 5 km from infrastructure and human activity by 50–95\% for weeks, months or even years and increased use of remaining undisturbed habitat far beyond those distances. The extent could vary with type of disturbance, sex, terrain, season, and sensitivity of herds. Of 85 studies reviewed, 83\% of the regional studies concluded that the impacts of human activity were signiWcant, while only 13\% of the local studies did the same. Accurate assessment of impacts from human activity requires regional-scale studies, a pattern conWrmed in a few long-term (decades) preand post-development studies. Such long-term studies are needed to improve understanding of both temporal and spatial patterns.},

	abstract = {We made monthly surveys of {\textgreater} 2000 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) from 1977 to 1987 before and after the construction of the Blue Lake hydroelectric reservoir in order to study the progressive impact of infrastructure development on wildlife. Following this development, reindeer densities within a 4-km radius declined gradually during winter to 8\% of pre-development densities without signiﬁcant changes in undeveloped control sites. During summer, reindeer gradually reduced use of areas within 4 km distance from roads and power lines to 36\% of predevelopment density, with subsequent 217\% increase in use of the few remaining sites located {\textgreater} 4 km from infrastructure. Reindeer reproduction declined progressively as habitat was lost. Assessments of individual development projects seriously underestimate the long-term eﬀects of the entire expanding infrastructure network. Piecemeal development has resulted in an estimated 70\% loss of undisturbed reindeer habitat across the last century in Norway. During this time the reindeer population has become fragmented into 26 isolated sub-populations. Our results show that any further infrastructure development will put the remaining European population of wild mountain reindeer at great risk, as further habitat fragmentation will make the remaining undisturbed patches too small for holding viable populations. A general model of impacts of infrastructure on wildlife is presented. We discuss the importance of controlling piecemeal development in infrastructure for conservation of wildlife and argue that minimizing infrastructure development is likely one of the largest challenges in wildlife conservation ahead.},

	abstract = {Roads are a widespread and increasing feature of most landscapes. We reviewed the scientific literature on the ecological effects of roads and found support for the general conclusion that they are associated with negative effects on biotic integrity in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Roads of all kinds have seven general effects: mortality from road construction, mortality from collision with vehicles, modification of animal behavior, alteration of the physical environment, alteration of the chemical environment, spread of exotics, and increased use of areas by humans. Road construction kills sessile and slow-moving organisms, injures organisms adjacent to a road, and alters physical conditions beneath a road. Vehicle collisions affect the demography of many species, both vertebrates and invertebrates; mitigation measures to reduce roadkill have been only partly successful. Roads alter animal behavior by causing changes in home ranges, movement, reproductive success, escape response, and physiological state. Roads change soil density, temperature, soil water content, light levels, dust, surface waters, patterns of runoff, and sedimentation, as well as adding heavy metals (especially lead), salts, organic molecules, ozone, and nutrients to roadside environments. Roads promote the dispersal of exotic species by altering habitats, stressing native species, and providing movement corridors. Roads also promote increased hunting, fishing, passive harassment of animals, and landscape modifications. Not all species and ecosystems are equally affected by roads, but overall the presence of roads is highly correlated with changes in species composition, population sizes, and hydrologic and geomorphic processes that shape aquatic and riparian systems. More experimental research is needed to complement post-hoc correlative studies. Our review underscores the importance to conservation of avoiding construction of new roads in roadless or sparsely roaded areas and of removal or restoration of existing roads to benefit both terrestrial and aquatic biota.},

In Australia, there has been a recent renewed interest in the deﬁnition and application of ecological thresholds in the conservation of threatened fauna and ﬂora, modelling the impact of habitat loss, modiﬁcation and fragmentation on terrestrial biota, management of pest plant and animal species, and development of natural resource management policies and plans. This paper reviews the threshold concept from an ecological perspective. It considers the deﬁnition, types and behaviour of this phenomenon. The theoretical and empirical evidence for their purported existence is reviewed and their potential utility in biodiversity conservation and natural resource management is discussed, along with key issues relating to their use.},

              Human pressures on the environment are changing spatially and temporally, with profound implications for the planet’s biodiversity and human economies.

Still, 75\% the planet’s land surface is experiencing measurable human pressures. Moreover, pressures are perversely intense, widespread and rapidly intensifying in places with high biodiversity. Encouragingly, we discover decreases in environmental pressures in the wealthiest countries and those with strong control of corruption. Clearly the human footprint on Earth is changing, yet there are still opportunities for conservation gains.},

	abstract = {To meet the expanding land use required for wind energy development, a better understanding of the effects on terrestrial animals’ responses to such development is required. Using GPS-­data from 50 freely ranging female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in the Malå reindeer herding community, Sweden, we determined reindeer calving sites and estimated reindeer habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSF). RSFs were estimated at both second-­ (selection of home range) and third-­order (selection within home range) scale in relation to environmental variables, wind farm (WF) development phase (before construction, construction, and operation), distance to the WFs and at the second-­order scale whether the wind turbines were in or out of sight of the reindeer. We found that the distance between reindeer calving site and WFs increased during the operation phase, compared to before construction. At both scales of selection, we found a significant decrease in habitat selection of areas in proximity of the WFs, in the same comparison. The results also revealed a shift in home range selection away from habitats where wind turbines became visible toward habitats where the wind turbines were obscured by topography (increase in use by 79\% at 5 km). We interpret the reindeer shift in home range selection as an effect of the wind turbines per se. Using topography and land cover information together with the positions of wind turbines could therefore help identify sensitive habitats for reindeer and improve the planning and placement of WFs. In addition, we found that operation phase of these WFs had a stronger adverse impact on reindeer habitat selection than the construction phase. Thus, the continuous running of the wind turbines making a sound both day and night seemed to have disturbed the reindeer more than the sudden sounds and increased human activity during construction work.},

Nonetheless, prior estimates of natural intact vegetation (NIV) in the hotspots are generally imprecise, indirect, coarse, and/or dated. Using moderate- and high-resolution satellite imagery as well as maps of roads, settlements, and ﬁres, we estimate the current extent of NIV for the hotspots. Our analysis indicates that hotspots retain 14.9\% of their total area as NIV (\$3,546,975 km2). Most hotspots have much less NIV than previously estimated, with half now having 610\% NIV by area, a threshold beneath which mean NIV patch area declines precipitously below 1000 ha. Hotspots with the greatest previous NIV estimates suffered the greatest apparent losses. The paucity of NIV is most pronounced in biomes dominated by dry forests, open woodlands, and grasslands, reﬂecting their historic afﬁnities with agriculture, such that NIV tends to concentrate in select biomes. Low and declining levels of NIV in the hotspots underscore the need for an urgent focus of limited conservation resources on these biologically crucial regions.},

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clariﬁed how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reﬂect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual uniﬁcation across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a ﬁxed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on ﬂows of energy and matter. These ﬁndings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

	abstract = {Wildlife species may respond to industrial development with changes in distribution. However, discerning a response to development from diﬀerences in habitat selection is challenging. Since the early 1990s, migratory tundra Bathurst caribou Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus in the Canadian Arctic have been exposed to the construction and operation of two adjacent open-pit mines within the herd’s summer range. We developed a statistical approach to directly estimate the zone of inﬂuence (area of reduced caribou occupancy) of the mines during mid-July-mid-October. We used caribou presence recorded during aerial surveys and locations of satellite-collared cow caribou as inputs to a model to account for patterns in habitat selection as well as mine activities. We then constrained the zone of inﬂuence curve to asymptote, such that the average distance from the mine complex where caribou habitat selection was not aﬀected by the mine could be estimated. During the operation period for the two open-pit mines, we detected a 14-km zone of inﬂuence from the aerial survey data, and a weaker 11-km zone from the satellite-collar locations. Caribou were about four times more likely to select habitat at distances greater than the zone of inﬂuence compared to the two-mine complex, with a gradation of increasing selection up to the estimated zone of inﬂuence. Caribou are responding to industrial developments at greater distances than shown in other areas, possibly related to ﬁne dust deposition from mine activities in open, tundra habitats. The methodology we developed provides a standardized approach to estimate the spatial impact of stressors on caribou or other wildlife species.},

Here we examine ZOI around two diamond mines in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada from 1998 to 2017. In this paper, we further develop segmented/piecewise regression methods to analyze collar location and aerial survey data with a focus on yearly trend in ZOI for the Bathurst caribou herd. A base habitat model was initially formulated to account for habitat selection around mines followed by estimation of ZOI distance and magnitude. Seasonal ranges of the herd contracted from 2009 to 2017 due to decline in herd size, which influenced the distribution of caribou relative to the mines as well as larger scale habitat selection. Models with year-specific estimates of ZOI were more supported than models assuming a constant ZOI across years. Significant ZOI’s occurred for aerial survey and/or collar data in 9 of 15 years from 2003 to 2017 when both mines were in full operation, with ZOI distances ranging from 6.1 to 18.7 km. Non-significant ZOI’s occurred from 1998 to 2002 before both mines were fully operational. Caribou were attracted to lakes in drought years which significantly influenced distribution relative to mines as well as the magnitude of the ZOI detected. The ZOI extent averaged 7.2 km (CI = 3.8–10.5) when standardized for mean levels of drought. Our analysis suggests that ZOI varies both annually and spatially because of the location of mines relative to habitat selection and seasonal range size. Therefore, exacting analysis methods that account for these sources of variation are required for robust ZOI estimates. Segmented regression methods have become available in the R statistical program that allow flexible ZOI estimation for implementation of the methods in this study for caribou or other wildlife species.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term “fragmentation” should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

	abstract = {Rapid urbanization threatens urban green spaces and vegetation, demonstrated by a decrease in connectivity and higher levels of fragmentation. Understanding historic spatial and temporal patterns of such fragmentation is important for habitat and biological conservation, ecosystem management and urban planning. Despite their potential value, Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) measures have not been suﬃciently exploited in monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban areas. LISA statistics are an important structural measure that indicates the presence of outliers, zones of similarity (hot spots) and of dissimilarity (cold spots) at proximate locations, hence they could be used to explicitly capture spatial patterns that are clustered, dispersed or random. In this study, we applied landscape metrics, LISA indices to analyse the temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation patterns of vegetation patches in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe using Landsat series data for 1994, 2001 and 2017. Analysis of landscape metrics showed an increase in the fragmentation of vegetation patches between 1994–2017 as shown by the decrease in mean patch size, an increase in number of patches, edge density and shape complexity of vegetation patches. The study further demonstrates the utility of LISA indices in identifying key hot spot and cold spots. Comparatively, the highly vegetated northern parts of the city were characterised by signiﬁcantly high positive spatial autocorrelation (p {\textless} 0.05) of vegetation patches. Conversely, more dispersed vegetation patches were found in the highly and densely urbanized western, eastern and southern parts of the city. This suggest that with increasing vegetation fragmentation, small and isolated vegetation patches do not spatially cluster but are dispersed geographically. The ﬁndings of the study underline the potential of LISA measures as a valuable spatially explicit method for the assessment of spatial clustering and fragmentation of urban vegetation patterns.},

We assessed relationships between past deforestation and existing networks of highways, navigable rivers, and all other roads, including more than 190,000 km of unofﬁcial roads. We found that deforestation was much higher near roads and rivers than elsewhere in the Amazon; nearly 95\% of all deforestation occurred within 5.5 km of roads or 1 km of rivers. Protected areas near roads and rivers had much lower deforestation (10.9\%) than did unprotected areas near roads and rivers (43.6\%). If one assumes that existing protected areas halt deforestation, then we estimate that 39,462 km2 of expected forest clearing would have been avoided. However, if one assumes that protected areas merely displace deforestation to other locations, then we estimate that 34,501 km2 of expected clearing would have been displaced elsewhere. We conclude that proximity to transportation networks, particularly the rapidly growing unofﬁcial road network, is a major proximate driver of deforestation in Amazonia and that protected areas are having a strong mitigating effect on that risk.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impact of indirect habitat loss resulting from avoidance of human infrastructure is an important conservation priority. We evaluated resource selection for 10 global positioning system collared northern mountain woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in British Columbia, Canada, with seasonal resource selection functions (RSF) developed at the second-order (landscape) and third-order (within home range) scales. To estimate how much habitat was lost due to avoidance, we estimated the zone of inﬂuence (ZOI) around multiple developments and modeled realized and potential habitat. Potential habitat was approximated by removing the ZOI from RSF models. By calculating the spatial difference between potential and realized habitat we estimated the amount of indirect habitat loss. Caribou displayed hierarchical avoidance of development, with the greatest avoidance occurring at the secondorder. During both seasons caribou avoided high-use roads by 2 km and low-use roads by 1 km. In winter, caribou avoided town by 9 km compared to 3 km in summer. However, in summer caribou avoided mines by 2 km and cabins and camps by 1.5 km, while in winter when human activity was low, avoidance of these features was minor. As a result of avoidance of the cumulative ZOI, approximately 8\% and 2\% of high quality habitat was lost in the study area in winter and summer, respectively. Our study provides an approach to identify the extent and quality of habitat inﬂuenced by indirect avoidance. Conservation efforts should prioritize protecting areas of high quality habitat degraded by avoidance in the vicinity of human development.},

	abstract = {As the concepts of landscape ecology have been incorporated into other disciplines, the inﬂuence of spatial patterns on animal abundance and distribution has attracted considerable attention. However, there remains a signiﬁcant gap in the application of landscape ecology theories and techniques to wildlife research. By combining landscape ecology techniques with traditional wildlife habitat analysis methods, we deﬁned an ’organism-centered perspective’ for breeding bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) along the Hudson River, New York, USA. We intensively monitored four pairs of breeding eagles during the 1999 and 2000 breeding seasons, and collected detailed information on perch and forage locations. Our analysis focused on three critical habitat elements: available perch trees, access to foraging areas, and freedom from human disturbance. We hypothesized that eagle habitat selection relative to each of these elements would vary with the spatial scale of analysis, and that these scaling relationships would vary among habitat elements. We investigated two elements of spatial scale: grain and local extent. Grain was deﬁned as the minimum mapping unit; local extent was deﬁned by the size of an analysis window placed around each focal point. For each habitat element, we quantiﬁed habitat use over a range of spatial scales. Eagles displayed scale-dependent patterns of habitat use in relation to all habitat features, including multi-scale and threshold-like patterns. This information supports the existence of scale-dependant relationships in wildlife habitat use and allowed for a more accurate and biologically relevant evaluation of Hudson River breeding eagle habitat.},

	abstract = {Methods We propose 14 predictions derived from ﬁve hypotheses explaining what determines the scale of effect, and review the literature (if any) supporting each prediction. These predictions involve ﬁve types of factors: (A) species traits, (B) landscape variables, (C) biological responses (e.g. abundance vs. occurrence), (D) indirect inﬂuences, and (E) regional context of the study. We identify methodological issues that hinder estimation of the scale of effect.
Results Of the 14 predictions, only nine have been tested empirically and only ﬁve have received some empirical support. Most support is from simulation studies. Empirical evidence usually does not support predictions.
Conclusions The study of the spatial scale at which landscape variables inﬂuence biological outcomes is in its infancy. We provide directions for future},

	abstract = {The programming language R is widely used in many ﬁelds. We explored the extent of reported R use in the ﬁeld of ecology using the Web of Science and text mining. We analyzed the frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4\% in 2008 to 58.0\% in 2017. The top 10 packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workﬂows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These ﬁndings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use of R, it is a signiﬁcant component of contemporary analytics in the ﬁeld of ecology.},

Both previous studies indicated that reindeer were hypoxemic on the basis of pulse oximetry. We conducted a physiologic evaluation of these two protocols using arterial blood gases. Medetomidine (10 mg) and ketamine (200 mg) were administered by dart from the ground in Svalbard reindeer (October 2010) and from a helicopter for wild reindeer (March 2012). Of tested animals, all seven wild reindeer and five of seven Svalbard reindeer were hypoxemic before oxygen administration. Nasal oxygen insufflation (1 L/min for five Svalbard reindeer and one wild reindeer and 2 L/min for four wild reindeer) corrected hypoxemia in all cases evaluated. For reversal, all animals received 5 mg atipamezole per mg medetomidine intramuscularly.},
