Let, the natural suitability ($\eta$):

$\eta = \exp(lichen + TPI + ...)$ 

the human suitability ($\gamma$):

$\gamma = \exp(roads + houses + ...)$ 

Then, the total suitability ($\tau$) is:

$\tau = \eta \cdot \gamma$

The habitat loss is: 

$\eta - \tau = \eta - \eta \cdot \gamma = \eta \cdot (1-\gamma)$

We can then define, the human footprint ($\Lambda$) as:

$\Lambda = 1-\gamma$

Thus, habitat loss is simply: $\eta \cdot \Lambda$

in other words, the human footprint weighted by the natural quality of the habitat.

The percentage/proportion habitat loss would be:

$\frac{\eta - \tau}{\eta} = \frac{\eta - \eta \cdot \gamma}{\eta} = 1-\gamma = \Lambda$

or the human footprint
